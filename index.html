        <h2>How much has <span class = 'deaths'>COVID-19</span> worsened in Malaysia in 2021?</h2>
        <p class = 'pp'>
            There are a lot more cases and deaths in 2020 compared to 2021. 
            One of the main reasons to this is the <b><span class = 'deaths'>Delta</span></b> variant.
            The <b><span class = 'deaths'>Delta</span></b> variant is believed to be more than twice as 
            contagious as previous variants. We can see how much worse the <b><span class = 'deaths'>COVID-19</span></b> situation is in 2021
            compared to 2020 with the maps below.

                    <p style = "width: 100%" class = 'p1'>
                        Looking at the distribution of <span class = 'deaths'>COVID-19</span> cases in 2021, we can see that
                        <b>70.2%</b> of them are <b><span class = 'adult'>adults</span></b>. This makes sense because <b><span class = 'adult'>adults</span></b> make up of
                        most of the population in Malaysia.
                    </p>

                    <p style = "width:100%" class = 'p1'>
                        Also, due to the <b>lockdowns, school closures, and so on, <span class = 'child'>children</span> and <span class = 'ad'>adolescents</span>
                            go out a lot less</b>. Parents of young children also would not want to risk their child getting COVID-19.
                        Children of the elderly would also want the <b><span class = 'elder'>elderly</span> stay at home</b> stay at home because
                        old people have weaker immune systems.
                    </p>
                    <p style = "width:100%" class = 'p1'>
                        As we can see, more children got infected with COVID-19 compared to adolescents. This might
                        be because children have weaker immune systems than adolescents.

        <h2>How much do <span class = 'good'>vaccines</span> help in dealing with <span class = 'deaths'>COVID-19</span>?</h2>
        <p class = 'pp'>
            In the 3 graphs below, we can see how the <b>cases</b> start to <b>decrease</b> after <b><span class = 'good'>40.7%</span></b> of the population
            have been <b><span class = 'good'>fully vaccinated</span></b>. We can see also how the <b>deaths</b>
            start to <b>decrease</b> after <b><span class = 'good'>56%</span></b> of the population have been <b><span class = 'good'>fully vaccinated</span></b>.
            
        </p>
        <p class = 'pp'>
            Since there were no major changes to COVID-19 guidelines and protocols
            before the sharp decrease in COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, and the 
            vaccines have also been proven to be effective, we can say that 
            <b>the main reason why the <span class = 'deaths'>COVID-19 cases and deaths</span> have decreased are the </b><b><span class = 'good'>COVID-19 vaccines</span></b>.

                        Among all 45,627,770 doses of the vaccines administered, 50.2% of them
                        are from <b><span class = 'pfizer'>Pfizer</span></b>. This is not a surprise because <b><span class = 'pfizer'>Pfizer</span></b>'s <b><span class = 'good'>COVID-19 vaccine</span></b> was the <b>first COVID-19 vaccine</b> listed by the 
                        <b>World Health Organisation (WHO)</b>
                        for emergency use. <b><span class = 'pfizer'>Pfizer</span></b>'s vaccine was also the first COVID-19 vaccine approved by the 
                        <b>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</b> (FDA). 

                        Furthermore, <b><span class = 'pfizer'>Pfizer</span></b>'s' COVID-19 vaccine has <b><span class = 'good'>91.3% efficacy</span></b> against symptomatic COVID-19.
