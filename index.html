        <h2>How much has <span class = 'deaths'>COVID-19</span> worsened in Malaysia in 2021?</h2>
        <p class = 'pp'>
            There are a lot more cases and deaths in 2020 compared to 2021. 
            One of the main reasons to this is the <b><span class = 'deaths'>Delta</span></b> variant.
            The <b><span class = 'deaths'>Delta</span></b> variant is believed to be more than twice as 
            contagious as previous variants. We can see how much worse the <b><span class = 'deaths'>COVID-19</span></b> situation is in 2021
            compared to 2020 with the maps below.

                        Looking at the distribution of <span class = 'deaths'>COVID-19</span> cases in 2021, we can see that
                        70.2% of them are <b><span class = 'adult'>adults</span></b>. This makes sense because <b><span class = 'adult'>adults</span></b> make up of
                        most of the population in Malaysia.
                    </p>

                    <p style = "width:100%" class = 'p1'>
                        Also, due to the <b>lockdowns, school closures, and so on, <span class = 'child'>children</span> and <span class = 'ad'>adolescents</span>
                            go out a lot less</b>. Parents of young children also would not want to risk their child getting <span class = 'deaths'>COVID-19</span>.
                        Children of the <b><span class = 'elder'>elderly</span></b> would also make sure that the <b><span class = 'elder'>elderly</span></b> stay at home because
                        old people have weaker immune systems.
                    </p>
                    <p style = "width:100%" class = 'p1'>
                        As we can see, <b><span class = 'child'>children</span></b> are more likely to get infected compared to adolescents. This might
                        be because <b><span class = 'child'>children</span></b> have <b>weaker immune systems</b> than <b><span class = 'ad'>adolescents</span></b>.

        <h2>How much do <span class = 'good'>vaccines</span> help in dealing with <span class = 'deaths'>COVID-19</span>?</h2>
        <p class = 'pp'>
            After reaching around the 50% mark for percentage of population <b><span class = 'good'>fully vaccinated</span></b>,
            the deaths and cases start to decrease. 
        </p>
        <p class = 'pp'>
            Since there have been no major changes to <span class = 'deaths'>COVID-19</span> guidelines and protocols
            before the sharp decrease in <span class = 'deaths'>COVID-19</span> cases in Malaysia, and the 
            <b><span class = 'good'>vaccines</span></b> have also been proven to be effective, we can say that 
            the main reason why the <span class = 'deaths'>COVID-19 cases and deaths</span> have decreased are the <b><span class = 'good'>COVID-19 vaccines</span></b>.
        </p>
        <p class = 'pp'>
            In the 3 graphs below, we can effectively see how the cases start to decrease after <b><span class = 'good'>40.7%</span></b> of the population
            have been <b><span class = 'good'>fully vaccinated</span></b>.

                        Among all 45,627,770 doses of the vaccines administered, 50.2% of them
                        are from <b><span class = 'pfizer'>Pfizer</span></b>. This is not a surprise because <b><span class = 'pfizer'>Pfizer</span></b>'s <b><span class = 'good'>COVID-19 vaccine</span></b> was the <b>first COVID-19 vaccine</b> listed by the 
                        <b>World Health Organisation (WHO)</b>
                        for emergency use. <b><span class = 'pfizer'>Pfizer</span></b>'s vaccine was also the first COVID-19 vaccine approved by the
